# Solar-System-Rust

A Rust implementation of the Solar System simulation project from UNIPV.

This repo contain my first big project with Rust as main tool, a numeric simulation of the Solar System with some graphic library.
The original version in C++ has been written by Prof. A. Rimoldi and reviewed by the Prof. A. Negri from UNIPV.

In the original version the graphics comed from the CERN toolkit ROOT. For this remake i will use one of the "Game-making" graphic library built for Rust by the community.
